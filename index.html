<h1>Welcome to the world of Vocaloids!</h1>
<h4>Hey! Are you tired of hearing the same 6 songs over and over on the radio? Do you think today's pop "stars" are nothing more than synthetic, artificial, vacuous pin-ups with meaningless and simplistic beats, whose voice needs a team of post-processing professionals to sound passable? Do you sometimes think to yourself: "why do we need that girl up front to begin with? The tech is doing all the work anyway"?
<p></p>
Enter  <a href="https://ec.crypton.co.jp/pages/prod/vocaloid">Crypton Future Media</a>, a Japan-based audio production company, which created the Vocaloid song-creation software. Using sampled phonemes from an actual human singer, completely novel songs can be created offline, offering a potentially limitless repertoire. Together with a colorful, anime-style avatar matched with each singer's vocal bank, the Vocaloid character team was born, for us plebes to idolize, obsess over, and most importantly, purchase countless figurines in a never-ending quest to fill the gaping hole in our meaningless existence. Ehm. And look at how pretty they all are! Below are some of the most popular. Which one will be your favorite?</h4>

<h2> Miku Hatsune: </h2>

Hi! I'm Miku. I was born on August 31st, 2007, making me about 10 years old at the moment, a super-hot babe by Japanese standards. My "official" age, though, is 16. I'm kind of a self-absorbed little priss - I like to sing about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O17f3lB7BFY">how wondeful I am </a>, show off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LG7wo82ivs">how fast I can sing</a> and sing deceptively-innocent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjtmCV2pOUc">romantic songs</a> while holding a "mic" in suggestive poses. Haha yeah I like to hog the stage. I think everyone's pretty sick of me by now. Once in a while I make an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqps4anhz0Q">actually good song</a> so they keep me around, I guess.

<h2> Len Kagamine:</h2>

Hi! I'm Len. Together with my twin sister / love interest Rin we make the Kagamine mirror-images. I'm the left side, get it? Think of us as the younger, saccarine versions of Jamie and Cersei, before anyone told us incest was bad. Being at the ripe old age of 14, I'm pretty much done with any emotional development. I like to sing age-appropriate songs about <a href="https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/44873.jpg">my penis</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIA-vEJB1Aw">being horny all the time</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNmKnCNLyM">my penis</a>. Yeah. My penis is awesome.

<h2> Rin Kagamine:</h2>

Hey pedos! Guess what? I'm gonna be your favorite! Even though I'm kind of old and washed-up by now at 14, I still got the body of an 11-year old. And with my squeaky, high-pitched voice and suuuuper tight hotpants, I can make you feel that special feeling you used to get, before that night with uncle Ronnie. Wannna be my boyfriend? I'm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ1gEDquuyQ">really sweet</a> and make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k11ZfUy8ls">really sweet girlfriend</a>. Just kidding! I'm a possesive little c*nt. I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZic8VVaORA">duo with my twin</a> everyone keeps going on about, but he kind of overshadows me there.

Hey guys. I don't have much of a personality, but with this set of boobs, can you blame me? At 18, I basically hit menopause 6 months ago. Good thing I have these boobs to keep you interested. I'm like the slightly less perky version of Miku with pink hair. Everyone loves pink hair. And boobs. Hey you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScSW9C3DF18">wanna see my boobs bounce</a>? I can also sing about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k11ZfUy8ls">dumping you</a> or just some other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbVahCHDw4">random shit</a> I get away with because I have big boobs. Yeah I have big boobs.

<h2> Gumi Megpoid:</h2>

Hey! I'm the one girl here that's actually fun to be with! I have green hair! You can't go wrong with green hair. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkN_QpmnFM">kick ass rock songs</a>! I'm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdJCnnUV1mo">no saint</a> and I will be completely tolerant to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP90Wnj0LTo">your sexual preferences</a> haha! I also have a f*ing sweet collab with Rin. About <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3cUqzc0x4s">blowjobs</a>. Do you really care about my age at this point?

So Crypton wanted another male singer that was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiTJ7UALdE">actually male</a> and created me. Problem is, I sound like crap and nobody really likes me. I try and make up for it by being an imbecile and singing about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGLTccscwnM">ice cream</a>. Or letting Miku use me for her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As-6WPDqsdM">Victorian-era fantasies</a>. Yeah I'm basically useless.
